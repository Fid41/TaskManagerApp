# TaskManagerApp


Overview: A task manager app allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage their tasks. Users can log in, view their personal tasks, and mark them as complete. The system will handle user authentication, CRUD operations for tasks, and interaction with a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.
